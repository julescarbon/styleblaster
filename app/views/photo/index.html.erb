    <h2>About Styleblaster</h2>
    <p>
      Since the early 2000s, Williamsburg has been a neighborhood popular with a new cultural elite, the heirs of the artists and hipsters who in years past were attracted by its location, one subway stop from Manhattan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in 2012, the neighborhood is poised on the cusp of a new change as the repercussions of recent zoning changes, combined with condo construction, have literally paved the way for a new breed of stylish and sassy individuals.  A place for the fashionable to be seen, Williamsburg's stretch of Bedford Avenue is often described as a modern Haight-Ashbury, a cultural mecca for the Millenial generation.
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer the changing times, we introduce Styleblaster, a realtime account of what people in Williamsburg are wearing.  Unlike a typical streetstyle blog, Styleblaster documents all -- the visiting fashion plates, the hipsters and have-nots, the native Polish and Italian proud who have for years called this neighborhood home.  And above all -- the dapper salarymen and businesswomen who stand to inherit the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Situated a block from the hellmouth of the Bedford "L" subway train, our camera aims down the street, capturing Williamsburg on the hoof.  Moments after a person enters into the frame, the camera snaps, sending its image onto our blog.  For the online fashion browser, a boon: the blog updates in realtime, showcasing each new image as quick as it can be appraised.  Online viewers can watch a live feed, peruse a recent history of images, or compare shots over the days and weeks as FW-2012 blossoms into SS-2013.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe this service fills a need for live fashion information, with a unique and unmatched vantage point on the hippest block in New York City.  It will quickly become a destination for New York City peacocks to traipse by and show off what makes the neighborhood hop.  For the savvy, a place to be seen.  For the flaneur, a bounty of style.  At home or online, fashion has a new destination.
